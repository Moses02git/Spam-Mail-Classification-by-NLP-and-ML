## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying emails as either **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a combination of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. The goal is to build an efficient classifier capable of distinguishing between legitimate and spam emails based on the content.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization using methods such as TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
- **Model Training:** Machine Learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained and evaluated.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure model performance.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly interface to classify emails in real-time.

## How to Execute the Project
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python** (Version 3.7 or later)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)


### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Project
Launch the interface using **Streamlit**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the `spam_classifier.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` files are present in the project directory, as they are required for the classification.
- Modify the `config.json` file if you wish to customize parameters such as vectorization or model settings.
